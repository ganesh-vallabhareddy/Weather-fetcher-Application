# Weather-fetcher-Application

## This Application is used to show the Current weather condtitions of any city present in the World ! 

### 1) All the Confidential information about cities and their current weather conditions is present in this weather API - "https://openweathermap.org/api" 
### 2) This information is present in JSON, HTML, XML formats.
### 3) In this project, I have made API requests using python.
### 4) From these requests, I interpreted the data & displayed it on the GUI which I have created using "tkinter" Library.

## Here is the GUI

### Example 1: Current Weather Conditions of Delhi

### Example 3: This message gets displayed if you enter any wrong city name

## Therefore, In this way you can display the Current weather conditions of any city in the entire world.. by making requests using python from the weather API!!!
